<h2>Why the Same Words Feel Different to Different People</h2>

<p>
In many workplaces, there is a manager who speaks very directly.
They are not trying to be rude, but they struggle to adjust their words.
</p>

<p>
They focus on results, efficiency, and problem-solving.
Because of this, they often say things in a blunt way.
</p>

<p>
Some employees understand this and are not bothered.
Others find the same words stressful or discouraging.
This is where tension begins, even when no one has bad intentions.
</p>

<h3>A Workplace Conversation</h3>

<div class="dialogue">
  <p><span class="speaker">Manager:</span><br>
  “This report is confusing. You should have organized it better.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Employee:</span><br>
  “Okay… I’ll revise it.”</p>

  <p>
  The meeting ends, but the employee feels uncomfortable.
  </p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Employee (later, to a coworker):</span><br>
  “I know he’s not a bad person. He’s actually helpful sometimes.
  But the way he talks really bothers me.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Coworker:</span><br>
  “What do you mean?”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Employee:</span><br>
  “He always sounds angry or disappointed.
  When he says things like that in front of everyone, it makes me feel small.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Coworker:</span><br>
  “I don’t think he realizes how it sounds.
  He talks to everyone the same way.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Employee:</span><br>
  “I know. That’s what makes it confusing.
  I don’t think he’s attacking me, but I still feel tense every time.”</p>
</div>

<h3>A Difficult but Honest Conversation</h3>

<div class="dialogue">
  <p><span class="speaker">Manager:</span><br>
  “I noticed you were quiet in the last meeting.
  Is everything okay?”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Employee:</span><br>
  “Yes, mostly. I just wanted to mention something.
  I know you’re focused on improving the work, and I appreciate that.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Employee:</span><br>
  “Sometimes, though, the way feedback comes out feels a bit harsh to me.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Manager:</span><br>
  “I’m not trying to be harsh. I’m just being direct.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Employee:</span><br>
  “I understand that.
  I know you don’t mean it negatively.
  I just wanted you to know how it feels on my side.”</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Manager:</span><br>
  “I didn’t realize it came across that way.
  I’ll try to be more aware of how I say things.”</p>

  <p>
  The issue is not completely solved,
  but both sides understand each other a little better.
  </p>
